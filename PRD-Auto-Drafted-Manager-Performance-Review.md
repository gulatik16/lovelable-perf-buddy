# PRD: Auto-Drafted Manager Performance Review

## Epic Description
Based on peer input and real-time work indicators from an employee's integrated tools, this feature automatically creates a preliminary draft of a performance review for people managers. By providing data-driven, modifiable summaries of employee contributions and behavior, it reduces bias, improves review accuracy, and saves significant time for managers.

## Business Case
Managers frequently struggle to recall specific contributions of each direct report across review periods, resulting in reviews that are vague, generic, or inadvertently biased. This leads to reduced employee trust, inconsistent assessments, and increased administrative overhead. By automating the initial draft generation using real work signals and peer feedback, managers save substantial time while delivering more accurate, evidence-based reviews that employees trust and value.

## User Discovery & Research
Secondary research and market analysis reveals these critical trends:
- Managers typically spend 2‚Äì4 hours per direct report drafting performance reviews (Gartner, 2023)
- Over 65% of employees feel their contributions are underrepresented in reviews due to managerial recall bias and lack of supporting data (SHRM study, 2022)
- 70% of performance review cycles experience delays due to incomplete or late manager submissions (Deloitte, 2023)
- 58% of managers report feeling unprepared to write comprehensive reviews due to lack of structured data about employee performance (McKinsey, 2023)

**Key Insights:** There is consistent dissatisfaction with both the review process and outcomes. Automating draft generation using real work signals significantly reduces time investment, increases transparency, and improves employee confidence in the review process.

## User Personas

| Criteria | Mr. ABC (Manager) | Ms. PQR (Employee) | Ms. XYZ (HRBP) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Goals** | Deliver comprehensive, fair reviews efficiently across multiple direct reports | Ensure contributions are accurately represented and recognized | Maintain review consistency, quality, and organizational compliance |
| **Pain Points** | Time-intensive review preparation, difficulty synthesizing peer feedback, recall bias affecting accuracy | Key accomplishments forgotten or undervalued, anxiety about self-advocacy | Delayed review cycles, incomplete submissions, generic feedback that lacks specificity |
| **Needs** | Pre-structured drafts with factual backing, streamlined editing workflow | Automated capture of contributions, reduced self-reporting burden | Quality oversight mechanisms, consistency monitoring across teams |

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** the review cycle is approaching and employee tools are integrated, **when** the AI processes work signals and peer feedback, **then** a comprehensive draft performance review is automatically generated and delivered to the manager two weeks before the submission deadline.

2. **Given** the manager opens the draft review, **when** they review the structured sections (achievements, collaboration, growth areas), **then** they can edit, enhance, and finalize the content with full visibility into data sources before submission.

3. **Given** the manager submits the finalized review, **when** the submission is complete, **then** the employee receives automated notification to schedule their review discussion meeting.

## OKR Metrics to Track

### Product Health Metrics:
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Average time to complete manager reviews:** Target reduction from 3 hours to 45 minutes per review
- üßæ **Review submission rate within deadline:** Target 95% on-time completion
- üë• **Peer feedback coverage per employee:** Target 80% of employees receive feedback from 3+ peers
- üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Manager and employee NPS related to review fairness/satisfaction:** Target NPS of 50+

### Engineering Health Metrics:
- üîå **API uptime for tool integrations:** Target 99.5% uptime
- üß† **Accuracy of AI-generated review drafts:** Target 85% manager satisfaction with initial drafts
- üìà **Draft generation latency:** Target <30 seconds for complete review generation
- üîÑ **Data freshness:** Work signals processed within 24 hours of occurrence

## Assumptions
- Employees and managers actively use integrated workplace tools (Slack, Jira, GitHub, Google Workspace)
- Performance cycle dates are available via HRIS integration or manually configured in system
- AI-generated content is explainable, traceable to sources, and fully editable by managers
- Peer feedback contributors are willing to provide regular, brief input when prompted
- Managers prefer structured drafts over blank templates for review creation

## Out of Scope
- Compensation recommendations or salary benchmarking functionality
- Legal performance improvement plan (PIP) documentation or compliance workflows
- In-application goal setting or OKR management features
- Employee career pathing or development plan generation
- Integration with payroll or HRIS compensation modules

## Solution

### Step 1: Integrations & Authentication (Data Flow)
- Admin configures review cycle dates and defines organizational scope
- Managers and employees authenticate workplace tools (Slack, Jira, Notion, Google Workspace) via secure OAuth flows
- System stores encrypted tokens and establishes webhook endpoints for real-time data ingestion

### Step 2: Work Signal Ingestion & Normalization
- Automated scheduler pulls work events (tickets completed, PRs merged, document collaborations, team communications) via APIs
- Data normalizer deduplicates events and converts to standardized schema with PII protection
- Classification engine tags events by performance dimensions (Delivery, Collaboration, Leadership, Innovation)
- Processed signals are stored in per-employee performance timelines

### Step 3: Peer Feedback Collection
- Intelligent Slack bot prompts 2‚Äì3 relevant peers monthly with contextual micro-surveys (30-second completion)
- Peers submit structured feedback via text, ratings, or quick tags
- AI aggregates responses, identifies themes, and maintains contributor anonymity
- Feedback summaries are integrated into employee performance profiles

### Step 4: Draft Generation
- Review aggregator compiles work signals and peer feedback for the defined review period
- Prompt builder creates structured prompts aligned with company performance rubrics
- LLM generates comprehensive manager draft with source attribution and confidence scoring
- Generated drafts are saved with full edit history and data provenance

### Step 5: Manager Review & Finalization
- Manager receives notification with direct link to editable draft interface
- Interface displays structured sections (Achievements, Collaboration, Growth Areas) with supporting data sources
- Manager can edit, expand, or reorganize content while maintaining source traceability
- Upon submission, final review is versioned and sent to employee for scheduling

### Step 6: Review Meeting Coordination
- System automatically triggers meeting scheduling workflow upon review completion
- Employee receives notification with scheduling interface and draft agenda
- Meeting confirmation updates all stakeholders and integrates with calendar systems

## Proposed Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components:
- **ReviewGenieBot**: AI assistant for review generation workflow
- **ReviewDraft**: Editable interface for manager review finalization
- **PerformanceReviewScheduling**: Meeting coordination interface
- **IntegrationSetup**: OAuth configuration for workplace tools
- **WorkSignalIngestion**: Real-time data processing dashboard

### Backend Services:
